## This is a readme for the Job-board website project - formulated on 06/April/2023

### This is the proposed outline for this project [Heps in the future **]

```
project setup: Set up the Django project with a database and create a virtual environment for the project. Install necessary packages and dependencies.
```

```
Create the backend: Build the backend using Django, create a RESTful API using Django Rest Framework (DRF), and connect it to the database. Define models for job listings, user profiles, and applications. Create views and serializers for API endpoints.
```

```
Build the frontend: Build the frontend using Angular, create components for job listings, user profiles, and applications. Use Angular Material for styling and UI components. Connect the frontend to the backend API using HttpClient to send and receive data.
```

```
User authentication: Implement user authentication using Django's built-in authentication system. Allow users to register, login, and logout. Use JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for secure authentication and authorization.
```

```
Job listings: Create a page to display job listings, allowing users to search and filter by job title, location, and other criteria. Implement pagination for long lists of job postings.
```

```
Job applications: Allow users to apply for jobs by submitting an application form with their resume and cover letter. Create a page for employers to manage job applications and view applicant information.
```

```
User profiles: Create user profiles where users can update their information, view their job applications, and manage their saved job listings.
```

```
Email notifications: Send email notifications to users when they apply for a job or when there are updates to their job applications. Send email notifications to employers when a new job application is received.
```

```
Testing and debugging: Conduct thorough testing and debugging of the application to ensure it is stable and error-free.
```

```
Deployment: Deploy the application to a web server using platforms such as Heroku, AWS or GCP.
```
